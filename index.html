				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<hr>
				<p> <img id="image" src="assets/images/prof-pic-2.jpg" alt="Alex Profile Pic" height="200" width="280"></a>
					I graduated in 2014 from UC Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's Degree in American History and Education. Since I was a child I wanted to be a teacher. However, starting a youth empowerment nonprofit at my university with 11 other student leaders revealed my passion for nonprofit development and community empowerment through youth programs.
					<br>
					<br>
					After graduation, I shifted my career focus from education to nonprofit work. I am now working as the Program and Development Assistant at Girls on the Run of the Bay Area, a girl-empowerment organization serving thousands of 3rd-8th grade girls across 5 Bay Area Counties.
					<br>
					<br>
					I am also certified as a Compost and Garden Educator by the San Francisco Department of the Environment. I volunteer at Garden for the Environment on 7th and Lawton in San Francisco. My dream is to own a business. Particularly a community-based business named Community Compost Project, a network connecting local food gardens to home composters.
					<br>
					<br>
					I am urrently enrolled in a full-stack web development boot camp at the UC Berkeley Extension learning front-end fundamentals, server-side architectures, database management systems, advanced front-end frameworks, data structures and algorithms.
